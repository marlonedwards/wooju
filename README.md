## Getting started

Wooju is built using three components: Unity client, Nakama server, and Cardinal server. The Unity client is located in the `Client` folder, the Nakama server is located in the `nakama` folder, and the Cardinal server is located in the `cardinal` folder.

Once you've cloned the repo and are in the directory, you can start the local Nakama and Cardinal servers by doing the following:

```bash
./start.sh
```
